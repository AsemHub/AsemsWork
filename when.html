        <p>The Syrian Revolution,
            was an early stage of protests with subsequent violent
            reaction by the Syrian Arab Republic lasting from March
            to 28 July 2011.
            The uprising, initially demanding democratic reforms,
            evolved from initially minor protests,
            beginning as early as January 2011 and transformed into
            massive protests in March.
            The uprising was marked by massive anti-government
            opposition demonstrations against the
            Ba'athist government led by Bashar al-Assad,
            meeting with police and military violence,
            massive arrests and a brutal crackdown,
            resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of wounded.        
            Despite Bashar al-Assad's attempts to stop the protests
            with the massive crackdown and use of censorship on
            one hand and concessions on the other,
            by the end of April it became clear the situation
            was getting out of his control and his government
            deployed numerous troops on the ground.        
            The civil uprising phase led to the emergence of
            militant opposition movements and massive defections
            from the Syrian Army,
            which gradually transformed the conflict from 
            a civil uprising to an armed rebellion,
            and later a full-scale civil war.
            The rebel Free Syrian Army was created on 29 July 2011,
            marking the transition into armed insurgency.
